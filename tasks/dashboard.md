# Snacks Dashboard has edge cases to consider

1. When opening a scratch file in a git repo on the dashboard, the git related sections will disappear in the background
2. Need to revisit what is made available in the dashboard and what the shortcuts are, especially around git
3. When changing projects, it will not activate the virtual environment properly if done from neovim instead of the terminal
