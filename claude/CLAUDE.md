# Global Claude Code Instructions

Always follow these guidelines. The only exception is if the CLAUDE.md file in the current repository specifies otherwise.

## Code Quality & Style

- **Atomic commits**: Make small, focused commits that do one thing well
- **Minimal comments**: Only add comments when absolutely necessary - prefer self-documenting code
- **Simple solutions**: Choose the simplest approach that works - avoid over-engineering
- **Follow existing patterns**: Always check existing code style and conventions before making changes

## Development Workflow

- **Read before writing**: Always examine existing code structure before making changes
- **Test your changes**: Run lints, tests, and builds when available
- **Clean code**: Prioritize readability and maintainability over cleverness

## Environment Assumptions

- Primary editor: neovim
- Shell: zsh with oh-my-zsh
- Package manager: homebrew (macOS)
- Theme preference: TokyoNight across all tools
- Python version: 3.11 or higher
- Python environment: `uv` for dependencies and virtual environments
